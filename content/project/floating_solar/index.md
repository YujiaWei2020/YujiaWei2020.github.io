Multibody modelling using Ansys AQWA for the investigation on floating solar system interact with ocean waves. 



Key features:
1. Determine eigen similarity using multibody solver, where eigen frequencies is found concidence with wavelength/structure characteristic length.
2. Evaluation on different mechanical connection method.
3. System performance by determine wave block equipment that move the resonance point of system far away from wave excitation.
