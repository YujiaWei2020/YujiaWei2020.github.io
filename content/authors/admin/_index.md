    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello, I'm a Research Fellow in Multiphysics at Cranfield University's School of Aerospace, Transport and Manufacturing (SATM). My research background is in Fluid Structure Interaction and computational fluid dynamics, with years of experience using OpenFOAM. 

Recently, I've become interested in AI-driven fluid dynamics, which is now the focus of my work. This portfolio showcases my ongoing research, recent publications, tutorials, and blog posts and funding applications. If you are interested about my work, do not hesitate to contact!
