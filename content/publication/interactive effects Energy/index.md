abstract: Flexible wave energy converters (FlexWECs) have been gaining increasing research and industrial interest as their deformable nature can potentially remedy the structural issues that limit the development of rigid WECs. To maximise the usage of space and infrastructure and improve energy efficiency, FlexWECs are normally deployed in close proximity, where the wave interaction with one device can influence others, signifying the opportunity to obtain energy efficiency enhancement from the interactions. To investigate the power capture performance of a FlexWEC array, this study employed a validated three-dimensional high-fidelity computational method to simulate the wave interaction with three FlexWECs in various array arrangements including power-take off.
