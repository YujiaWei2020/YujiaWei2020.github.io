abstract: Given the advantages of flexible wave energy converters (FlexWECs), such as deformation-led energy harnessing and structural loading compliance, there has been a significant interest in FlexWECs in both academia and industries. To simulate the FlexWEC interaction with ocean surface waves, a 3D computational fluid-structure interaction approach is developed in this study. The fluid and solid governing equations are discretized using finite difference and finite element methods, respectively. An immersed boundary method is used to couple the two independent grid systems. A novel numerical technique is introduced to model the dielectric elastomer generator (DEG) as the power take-off (PTO). The wave energy capture performance is analysed for different PTO configurations and at various wave conditions. Based on the obtained results, the PTO damping coefficient and the relative wavelength range that maximizes the capture width ratio (CWR) are determined. The wavefield results also reveal the presence of wave-height enhancement and attenuation points around a single FlexWEC, providing potential site selection references when deploying multiple FlexWECs in an array.
