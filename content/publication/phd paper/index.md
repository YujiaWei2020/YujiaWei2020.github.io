abstract: Commercial vessels have recently been increasing in size to meet the fast-growing demand for transportation and operations. However, this trend may result in more flexible or" softer" hulls. The flexible hull structure and high operational speed requirements bring the ship's natural frequency closer to the wave encounter frequency, increasing the probability of resonance or high-frequency vibrations. Therefore, hydroelastic effects and relevant loads should be considered when designing wave loads and evaluating the strength of large ships. A robust numerical model is in search of ship designers and regulators, intended to predict the impact of hydroelasticity in the initial stages of design as per the design regulations, where there exists a greater opportunity to make modifications and utilise high-fidelity tools to verify the performance of advanced designs. This study aims to fill this gap by performing robust numerical investigations based on open-source software on the seakeeping and hydroelastic analysis of a monohull under wave excitations. Firstly, a detailed literature review is presented to overview the previous theoretical and numerical methods for ship hydroelasticity. This review also includes a general comparison between these hydroelastic techniques and discusses the differences.
