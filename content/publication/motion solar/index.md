abstract: Modularized floating solar farms exhibit the potential to replace conventional steel-frame ones, effectively remedying hydroelastic issues of a very large floating structure through discrete modules with mechanical connections. However, the response of the discrete modules under cyclic wave loading has not been fully understood. This paper assesses the motion characteristics and expansibility of modularized floaters in waves, based on computational results from fluid–structural interaction simulations. A crucial factor, denoted as the ratio of frame length to wavelength⁠, is determined to predict the motions of a large floating solar system in head waves. Results indicate that the motion characteristics is predictable based on the R value. The empirical relationship between the R value and the motion of every unit in an array is analyzed. In particular, the results calculated from using the multiple-rigid-bodies
