abstract: Geometry optimization in industrial applications is challenging due to implicit fitness functions and physical constraints highly influenced by design inputs. This optimization cannot be easily handled using analytical solutions. Instead, parametric analysis of computational models often results in local optima, leading to uncertain optimization solutions. To address these problems, this paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm-neural network strategy (GA-NN) to identify the best combination of geometric parameters for a oleo-pneumatic shock absorber system to maximize its efficiency under certain working conditions. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both NNs and GAs. Within this framework, NNs approximate the fitness function based on design variables, while GAs broadly search for optimal variable combinations within design spaces. A comprehensive verification and validation process ensures the proposed framework's reliability. Additionally, a parametric analysis is conducted for the range of optimized geometries for varying aircraft dimensions and designed shock absorber pressure heads. This study aims to provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for shock absorber design, ensuring safe and efficient operations.
